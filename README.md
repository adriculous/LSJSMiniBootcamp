# Lambda School Javascript Mini-Bootcamp

This is a repo of all my assignments for the 4-day Lambda School Javascript Mini-Bootcamp. This is a prerequisite of Lambda School's bootcamp program, but I'm taking it so I can understand Javascript better and use this new skill for future job opportunities and possibly for future bootcamp enrollments.
